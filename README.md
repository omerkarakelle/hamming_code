# hamming_code
MATLAB Implementation of Hamming Code.

In Telecommunications Industry, Error Correction Codes are widely used in order to control errors that might be formed on the transmitted data over a noisy channel. Hamming Code is one of those Error Correction Codes that can detect two bit errors or can correct one bit error.

In this implementation, a bit stream of k bits are encoded to codeword of n bits, according to the Hamming Algorithm.
