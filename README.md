# hamming_code
MATLAB Implementation of Hamming Code.

In Telecommunications Industry, Error Correction Codes are widely used in order to control errors that might be formed on the transmitted data over a noisy channel. Hamming Code is one of those Error Correction Codes that can detect two bit errors or can correct one bit error.

The purpose of this implementation is to encode the given data of k bits to the codeword of n bits, according to Hamming Algorithm.
